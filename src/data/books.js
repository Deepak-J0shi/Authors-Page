      "I Was Never Me After You is an upcoming poetry collection published by Writer’s Pocket, scheduled for release in 2026. The book is a deeply personal exploration of love, separation, grief, and emotional change, written through poetry and reflective prose.\n\nRather than offering closure, the collection sits with unresolved emotions—those quiet moments after loss where identity begins to shift. The poems explore how love alters the self, how absence reshapes memory, and how time leaves subtle imprints on emotional landscapes.\n\nWritten in a minimalist and introspective style, the book focuses on emotional honesty, restraint, and vulnerability. It is intended for readers who find resonance in introspection and lived truth.",

      "120 Amazing Poems by Best 10 Writers – Volume 2 is a collective poetry anthology published by Manda Publishers. The book brings together poems that explore a wide emotional and thematic range, including love, loss, healing, nature, introspection, and the complexities of the human heart.\n\nEach poem in the collection reflects a unique voice while contributing to a larger lyrical journey that captures shared human experiences. The verses move between tenderness and grief, hope and reflection, offering readers moments of solace, inspiration, and emotional resonance.\n\nMy contribution to this volume consists of a dedicated section of poems centered on love, emotional loss, healing, and inner transformation. These poems are rooted in lived experience and introspection, focusing on emotional growth rather than resolution.",

    longDescription:
      "Yellow Days is a collaborative poetry anthology published by Writer’s Pocket that explores the quiet, joyful moments that add warmth and color to everyday life. Inspired by the symbolism of the color yellow, the collection reflects on emotions associated with happiness, comfort, laughter, nostalgia, and emotional connection.\n\nThe poems in Yellow Days capture simple yet meaningful experiences—laughing with friends, sharing moments with family, witnessing innocence, finding joy in small successes, or spending time doing what one loves. Rather than grand declarations, the anthology focuses on subtle emotional highs that often go unnoticed but leave lasting impressions.\n\nAs a contributing poet, my work in this anthology reflects themes of emotional awareness, lived experience, and the gentle beauty of ordinary moments. Yellow Days invites readers to pause, reflect, and embrace those fleeting instances of warmth that quietly brighten our lives.",
