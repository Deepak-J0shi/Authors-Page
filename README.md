* Clean, minimal aesthetic
* No bloated CSS files

---

## **Why Sanity CMS?**

# **UI/UX Approach**

### Reading-First Design

* Large readable fonts
* Generous spacing
* Calm color palette
* Minimal visual noise

---

### Clear Navigation

Home → Blogs → Poetry → Books → Contact

---

### Component Reusability

* Shared layout styles
* Consistent card design
* Unified typography system

---

### Subtle Interactions

* Hover transitions
* Micro-animations
* No heavy motion — content remains primary

---

# **Content & Rendering Flow**

### User visits website

→ React loads layout

### CMS content fetched (blogs & poems)

→ Rendered via PortableText

### Static content (books, images) loaded

→ Displayed via config

### Tailwind handles responsive styling

### Vercel serves optimized build

---

# **Challenges & Trade-Offs**

### Challenge — SPA Refresh Errors on Vercel

✔ Solved using proper SPA routing configuration.

---

### Challenge — Maintaining reading comfort across devices

✔ Solved with responsive typography & spacing.

---

### Trade-Off — CMS dependency

**Pros:** Easy updates, clean separation
**Cons:** Requires Sanity availability

---

# **Performance & Deployment Notes**

* Built with **Vite** → ultra-fast dev & build
* Deployed on **Vercel** → instant global delivery
* Tailwind ensures minimal CSS bundle
* CMS data fetched efficiently
* Optimized for long-form reading
